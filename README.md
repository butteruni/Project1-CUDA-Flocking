**University of Pennsylvania, CIS 5650: GPU Programming and Architecture,
Project 1 - Flocking**

* (TODO) YOUR NAME HERE
  * (TODO) [LinkedIn](), [personal website](), [twitter](), etc.
* Tested on: Windows 11, AMD Ryzen 7 8845HS, 3.80 GHz, RTX 4070 Laptop GPU (8GB)

**Result**

* For each implementation, how does changing the number of boids affect
  performance? Why do you think this is?
  * 
* For each implementation, how does changing the block count and block size
  affect performance? Why do you think this is?
  * 
* For the coherent uniform grid: did you experience any performance improvements
  with the more coherent uniform grid? Was this the outcome you expected?
  Why or why not?
  * 
* Did changing cell width and checking 27 vs 8 neighboring cells affect performance?
  Why or why not? Be careful: it is insufficient (and possibly incorrect) to say
  that 27-cell is slower simply because there are more cells to check!
